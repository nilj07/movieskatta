        <h1>
            Animal
        </h1>
        <p>
            Hi. This is a review of the movie Animal.

            <p>A film that’s neither entertaining nor has anything to say. The cinematic equivalent of a teenager having a
                hormonal temper tantrum.
            </p>

            <p> Ranbir Kapoor is Ranvijay, who, as you probably surmised from the trailer has everything money can buy,
            except his father’s love and attention. Never mind his poor mum enabling his bad behavior, all Vijay wants
            is to be able to spend his father Balbir’s birthdays with him, again mother, very much alive and standing
            around looking sad, is inconsequential. Denied this love, Vijay slowly turns into an “animal”, with
            uncontrollable instinct, acting upon every single intrusive thought in his man-brain. Also because Balbir is
            the richest or one of the richest men in India, nothing Vijay does, including straight-up mass murder, has
            any legal consequences. Law enforcement doesn’t exist in Balbir and Vijay’s world.
            </p>
            The film takes place in flashbacks, and I tried to figure out why. The first scene is a prosthetically aged
            Ranbir Kapoor in the year 2056, telling a group of men an inane story about a monkey in a jungle. Just like
            this scene, much of Animal’s screenplay presents sequence upon gory sequence, purely for the shock value
            they provide. Violence for violence’s sake, sexism for sexism’s sake, declarations of masculinity only
            because one can. “Sadly it’s a man’s world”, Vijay says to his wife in a scene, without a hint of awareness.
            You don’t have to tell us twice.


            The entire film illustrates it being set in a man’s world, using as many bullets and murders as possible. It
            is not a lament, like Nikhil Nagesh Bhatt’s ultra-violent KILL that premiered at TIFF, where violence is
            portrayed as a way of showing the trappings of masculinity, of resorting to use your manhood as a tool when
            all else fails, the one thing that gives you’re an automatic advantage in the world, regardless of your
            social status. In KILL, Raghav Juyal and his men murder on a train, because it’s the only option they are
            left with, to gather wealth in a system that doesn’t work for them. In Animal, Vijay is violent because no
            one booked him for a psych evaluation as a teenager. In this slasher movie men protect the honor of their
            families as real men, using swords, axes, and guns, with enough references to penis and body hair
            underlining this declaration.


            Anil Kapoor is Balbir, a businessman so preoccupied with his empire, that he seemingly doesn’t even
            retaliate or care upon realizing a teacher at school has physically assaulted his son. While the actor is,
            you know very good at his job, especially in the yell-y scenes where he tries to parent his enfant terrible.
            Aside from this though, the character is a ping pong ball bouncing around of a screenplay desperately trying
            to justify its protagonist’s rage with some semblance of a reason WHY it is translating as murderous. When
            Balbir is not yelling vocational platitudes like “I run a business across three different time zones”, he
            sits behind an office desk silently simmering, allowing his progeny to rain hell, clearing his conscience
            with the occasional “I don’t agree with your methods”.
